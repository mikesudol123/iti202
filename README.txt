Welcome to The Hunt for The Blade of Akash.

The game will begin with a prompt asking for your name.
Next, it will ask which direction you want your character to move.

Direction commands: North, South, East, West

Other commands: Health, Attack

To win the game:
Move along into the rooms searching for The Blade of Akash.
Collect items and other things to boost your health and attacks
Once you found The Blade of Akash, defeat the Dragon.
You canâ€™t win the game without defeating the Dragon with the blade.
Once you defeat the Dragon, escape the dungeon, and you win



WALKTHROUGH
The fastest way to win is go north twice, east once to get the blade of akash,
west to get back into the hallway, then north again to defeat the dragon
(note you must have the blade of akash to beat the dragon, otherwise you lose)
then east one more time to escaped

Currently the only way to die in this game due to the weakness of the traps and monsters is
to walk in and out of quick sand room from the dragons lair over and over navigation

Also fights are not fully implemented since you do not want the player to be able to die
so currently they function almost identically to traps
